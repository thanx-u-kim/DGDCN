# Dynamic Graph Diffusion Convolutional Network for Traffic Speed Prediction(DGDCN)

Implementation of **DGDCN (Dynamic Graph Diffusion Convolutional Network)** in PyTorch.  
This repository provides code and example setup for reproducing our experiments.

## 📌 Publication Status
> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This work is based on our manuscript currently under **major revision** for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.  
> The paper is **not yet published**, and details may change in the final accepted version.  
> The README and repository will be updated once the manuscript is accepted.

## Requirements
Our code is based on Python 3.8.13).
Tested on **PyTorch 1.11.0 (torch==1.11.0, CUDA 11.3)**.
Major dependencies are listed below:
- python==3.8.13
- numpy==1.22.4
- pandas==1.4.2
- torch==1.11.0 # PyTorch 1.11.0
- pytorch-lightning==1.6.4
- torchmetrics==0.9.0
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ✳️ Data Availability
Due to security and privacy restrictions, the dataset used in the paper **cannot be shared**.
Users may reproduce results with their own dataset following the same format.

### 📂 Required Files and Shapes
- `speed_data.csv` (`feat`):
  - Shape: **(T x N)**
- `inflow_adj_data.npy` & `outflow_adj_data.npy` (`in_adj`, `out_adj`):
  - Shape: **(T x N x N)**
- `dijkstra_matrix.csv` (`dijkstra`):
  - Shape: **(N x N)**
  - Shortest path distance matrix based on the road network topology

### 📌 Notes
- **T(Total Timesteps)** = total number of time steps.  
  - Example in our setting: `2880` (20 days × 144 steps per day, with 10-minute resolution).  
- **N(Number of Nodes)** = the number of road sections in the study area.  
- Data should be placed in `../input_data/` by default, or paths can be adjusted in the code.

### 📑 Example Code
```python
# Data Loading
feat = utils.load_dataset('../input_data/speed_data.csv')
in_adj = utils.load_adjacency('../input_data/inflow_adj_data.npy')
out_adj = utils.load_adjacency('../input_data/outflow_adj_data.npy')
dijkstra = utils.load_dijkstra('../input_data/dijkstra_matrix.csv')
```

## Run (Notebook)
1. Open the `main.ipynb` file.  
2. Execute all cells in order from top to bottom.  
3. Make sure the data path (`../input_data/`) matches your dataset location and adjust if necessary.  
4. Check the training arguments (`args`). The notebook provides default values for our model, but you may adjust them as needed.  
5. Running all cells will start training, save checkpoints, and produce outputs.  
6. At the end of the notebook, evaluation results (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and sample predictions will be displayed.
